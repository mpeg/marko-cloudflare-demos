# marko-run-cloudflare

@marko/run + cloudflare, with full bindings etc. 

TODO:
- For some reason @marko/run needs the baseAdapter, otherwise it doesn't work.
- Sometimes bundling related errors show up in dev, but they don't seem to last or affect anything. Need to investigate

## dev

```bash
bun run dev
```

## build

```bash
bun run build
```

## preview

```bash
bun run preview
```
